    <p class="p">This website began as a GitHub site where I could store DITA work for reuse that potential
      employers or clients could see. My previous employer had security requirements (nothing saved
      to the cloud, USB, or any other method of taking code offsite) that prevented me from saving
      any work samples, so I wanted to rebuild some of those. Also, I wanted a place to park some
      basic plugins and XSL code snippets that I could just download and repurpose. That kind of
      thing.</p>
    <p class="p">I started out in the newspaper business, first as a reporter and photographer, then moving on
      to photography, finally working as a copy editor at the Midland Reporter-Telegram in Midland,
      Texas. Copy editors not only edited stories, but designed the pages on Macs using QuarkXPress
      and other desktop publishing software. Occasionally (meaning most nights), the Mac server
      would have to be rebooted. I had begun to get interested in computers anyhow, and was one of
      the first people I knew to get a Mac for use at home, so eventually the network admin told me
      how to reboot the server as it would save his having to leave his home and drive back to the
      newspaper office.</p>
    <p class="p">From my tentative first steps <q class="q">messing with computers</q>, then moving on the pursue a
      technical communication degree, it was a only a matter of time before my discovery of
      structured authoring and my love of publishing (seriously, one of my favorite things to do at
      the newspaper was to go back and watch the press run; it was even better to take visitors back
      there and watch them gaze in rapt fascination as blank rolls of newsprint turned into copies
      of the newspaper that would soon be in the racks and boxes of stores and on the front lawns of
      thousands of subscribers—just like in the movies!) combined into the obsession with turning
      DITA into consumable content.</p>
