          <p class="p">This website began as a GitHub site where I could store DITA work for reuse that potential
            employers or clients could see. My previous employer had security requirements (nothing saved
            to the cloud, USB, or any other method of taking code offsite) that prevented me from saving
            any work samples, so I wanted to rebuild some of those. Also, I wanted a place to park some
            basic plugins and XSL code snippets that I could just download and repurpose. That kind of
            thing.</p>
            <p class="p">I started out in the newspaper business, first as a reporter and photographer, then moving on
              to photography, finally working as a copy editor at the Midland Reporter-Telegram in Midland,
              Texas. Copy editors not only edited stories, but designed the pages on Macs using QuarkXPress
              and other desktop publishing software. Occasionally (meaning most nights), the Mac server
              would have to be rebooted. I had begun to get interested in computers anyhow, and was one of
              the first people I knew to get a Mac for use at home, so eventually the network admin told me
              how to reboot the server as it would save his having to leave his home and drive back to the
              newspaper office.</p>
              <p class="p">From my tentative first steps <q class="q">messing with computers</q>, then moving on the pursue a
                technical communication degree, it was a only a matter of time before my discovery of
                structured authoring and my love of publishing (seriously, one of my favorite things to do at
                the newspaper was to go back and watch the press run; it was even better to take visitors back
                there and watch them gaze in rapt fascination as blank rolls of newsprint turned into copies
                of the newspaper that would soon be in the racks and boxes of stores and on the front lawns of
                thousands of subscribers—just like in the movies!) combined into the obsession with turning
                DITA into consumable content.</p>
                
                <p class="p">Bootstrap makes a lot of sense. I am taking the Udemy class by Colt Steele (yes, that is his
                  name) and seeing where I had sort of figured out some of it by looking at the source for Rob's
                  page and the OT pages. But taking a class is so much better, especially getting the context
                  and learning <q class="q">what the rules are</q> for a new technology or practice.</p>
